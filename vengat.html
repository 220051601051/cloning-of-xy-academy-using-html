</STYle></head><h1 style="color: black;">Mathematics research at the Ph.D. level often explores theoretical and applied aspects of mathematics, ranging from pure mathematics (like algebra, analysis, geometry) to more applied areas such as mathematical physics, cryptography, or operations research. The goal of earning a Ph.D. in mathematics is not only to master existing knowledge but also to make a unique contribution to the field through the discovery of new results, proofs, or methodologies.</h1>
